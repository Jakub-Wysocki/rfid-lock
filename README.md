# rfid-lock
This projects links ESP32 using ESP-IDF library with PN532 module. Esp32 communicates via SPI with PN532 and checking RFID tag. Then it sends it to the server using TCP protocol which check if the number is in the database. Depending on the result it sends aproppariate signal. This code is very messy just like this documentation. I have recently finished basic functions. I'll tidy that mess soon. Feel free to use it. I give it to the public domain.
